        Did you know that Americans throw away an estimated 80 billion pounds of
        food a year? That's about 30-40% of the US food supply! This is partly
        due to people buying too much food for them to even know what to do
        with. We here at Leftover Ingredients seek to help solve this problem by
        making sure nothing in your fridge is ever wasted. It's really a win-win
        situation your family and the earth!
